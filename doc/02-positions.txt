Positions

The grid

For all elements, SVG uses a coordinate system or grid system similar to the one used by canvas 
(and by a whole lot of other computer drawing routines). That is, the top left corner of the document 
is considered to be the point (0,0), or point of origin. Positions are then measured in pixels from 
the top left corner, with the positive x direction being to the right, and the positive y direction 
being to the bottom.

[...] suppose that the user agent can determine from its environment that "1px" corresponds 
to "0.2822222mm" (i.e., 90dpi). Then, for all processing of SVG content: [...] "1cm" equals 
"35.43307px" (and therefore 35.43307 user units)
