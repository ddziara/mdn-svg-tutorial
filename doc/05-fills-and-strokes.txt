Fills and Strokes

Basic coloring can be done by setting two attributes on the node: fill and stroke. 
Using fill sets the color inside the object and stroke sets the color of the line 
drawn around the object. You can use the same CSS color naming schemes that you 
use in HTML, whether that's color names (that is red), rgb values 
(that is rgb(255,0,0)), hex values, rgba values, etc.

 <rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100" stroke="blue" fill="purple"
       fill-opacity="0.5" stroke-opacity="0.8"/>

In addition, you can specify the opacity of either the fill or stroke separately 
in SVG. These are controlled by the fill-opacity and stroke-opacity attributes.

================================================
Stroke

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<svg width="160" height="140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1">
  <line x1="40" x2="120" y1="20" y2="20" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linecap="butt"/>
  <line x1="40" x2="120" y1="60" y2="60" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linecap="square"/>
  <line x1="40" x2="120" y1="100" y2="100" stroke="black" stroke-width="20" stroke-linecap="round"/>
</svg>

There are three possible values for stroke-linecap:

butt closes the line off with a straight edge that's normal (at 90 degrees) to the direction 
of the stroke and crosses its end.

square has essentially the same appearance, but stretches the stroke slightly beyond 
the actual path. The distance that the stroke goes beyond the path is half the stroke-width.

round produces a rounded effect on the end of the stroke. The radius of this curve is also 
controlled by the stroke-width.

Finally, you can also use dashed line types on a stroke by specifying the stroke-dasharray attribute.

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<svg width="200" height="150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1">
  <path d="M 10 75 Q 50 10 100 75 T 190 75" stroke="black"
    stroke-linecap="round" stroke-dasharray="5,10,5" fill="none"/>
  <path d="M 10 75 L 190 75" stroke="red"
    stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="1" stroke-dasharray="5,5" fill="none"/>
</svg>
